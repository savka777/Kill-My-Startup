Most founders discover their fatal competitive disadvantages too late, after months of building and thousands of dollars spent. Kill My Startup solves this by continuously monitoring your competitive landscape: tracking competitor metrics, analyzing social sentiment, and surfacing relevant news before you're caught off guard.

The technical challenge isn't collecting data, it's making sense of it. We use Perplexity's API strategically across four intelligence layers, each requiring different capabilities.

Competitor Discovery: starts with Sonar Pro. When users describe their startup, we need to identify not just obvious competitors, but adjacent players and emerging threats. Sonar Pro's advanced reasoning understands market relationships: for example, recognizing that an "AI meeting notes" startup competes with Otter.ai directly, but also with Notion's features and Slack's integrations. This typically finds 40% more relevant competitors than simple keyword searches.

Parameter Extraction: uses regular Sonar to systematically gather pricing, features, and positioning from competitor websites. Real-time retrieval means we catch pricing changes within hours, not weeks. What used to take analysts 2-3 hours per competitor now takes under 5 minutes.

News Aggregation: leverages Sonar's recency bias and source credibility assessment to filter signal from noise. Users get daily briefings with only high-impact developments - funding rounds, product launches, strategic moves - cutting news volume by 85% while maintaining complete coverage.

Sentiment Analysis: It is the most complex layer. We combine RapidAPI (for raw comment volume from X and Reddit) with Sonar's reasoning to understand context and detect nuance. For Hacker News, we use domain-filtered Sonar queries. For broader social networks, we configure Sonar to aggregate across LinkedIn, Quora, and niche communities. This hybrid approach improved sentiment accuracy from 72% to 91%.

The impact is measured: users catch competitive moves 3.2 days faster on average, making proactive decisions instead of reactive scrambles. Perplexity's combination of reasoning and real-time retrieval transformed our platform from a data aggregator into an intelligence system that helps founders win.
